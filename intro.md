# Introduction

Across the country, in fifty state capitals, 7,383 state legislators pass laws and debate policy that affects the residents of their states.¹ With few exceptions, state legislators are either Democrats or Republicans, and such partisan labels at the state level represent similar divisions in ideology at the federal level. A Democratic state legislator from Nevada has much more in common with one from New Jersey than he does with the Republican sitting next to him in the Nevada Capitol. Gone are the old lines of division that might separate a state legislator, such as regional or demographic splits. Indeed, Tip O’Neill’s famous maxim that “all politics are local” has certainly fallen flat in recent years. 

Daniel Hopkins, in his _The Increasingly United States_, seeks to explain why. Firstly, voters are “engaged with and knowledgeable about national politics to the exclusion of state or local politics."² That is, national issues dominate local ones with the rise of the 24-hour TV network and the demise of the local newspaper –  neither fixing potholes nor building parks are sexy topics that prompt online outrage or spirited debate around the dinner table. Secondly, “voters’ choices in state and local races echo those in national races,” that is, they pick candidates of the same party up and down the ballot.² Hopkins argues that this is “the product of a party and interest-group constellation that is funded nationally and that increasingly offers voters similar choices in all parts of the country.”² 

It is this secondary tenet, that of voters becoming more partisan in casting their ballot, that I draw particular attention towards. In particular, there has been an increasing connection between the Presidential races and state legislative elections. For example, Steven Rogers finds that presidential popularity is directly correlated with the likelihood that members of the President’s party will get challengers in their elections, and indeed the percentage of the vote those challengers get.³  To explore this phenomenon, I acquired a dataset of state legislative elections, and the results of the Presidential race in their districts. The specifics of the construction of this data can be found in the **Methodology** tab.
