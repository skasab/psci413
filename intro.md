# Introduction

Across the country, in fifty state capitals, 7,383 state legislators pass laws and debate policy that affects the residents of their states.¹ With few exceptions, state legislators are either Democrats or Republicans, and such partisan labels at the state level represent similar divisions in ideology at the federal level. A Democratic state legislator from Nevada has much more in common with one from New Jersey than he does with the Republican sitting next to him in the Nevada Capitol. Gone are the old lines of division that might separate a state legislator, such as regional or demographic splits. Indeed, Tip O’Neill’s famous maxim that “all politics is local” has certainly fallen flat in recent years. 

Daniel Hopkins, in his _The Increasingly United States_, seeks to explain why. Firstly, voters are “engaged with and knowledgeable about national politics to the exclusion of state or local politics."² That is, national issues dominate local ones with the rise of the 24-hour TV network and the demise of the local newspaper – neither fixing potholes nor building parks are sexy topics that prompt online outrage or spirited debate around the dinner table. Secondly, “voters’ choices in state and local races echo those in national races,” that is, they pick candidates of the same party up and down the ballot.² Hopkins argues that this is “the product of a party and interest-group constellation that is funded nationally and that increasingly offers voters similar choices in all parts of the country.”² 

It is this secondary tenet, that of voters becoming more partisan in casting their ballot, that I draw particular attention towards. In particular, there has been an increasing connection between the Presidential races and state legislative elections. For example, Steven Rogers finds that presidential popularity is directly correlated with the likelihood that members of the President’s party will get challengers in their elections, and indeed the percentage of the vote those challengers get.³ 

Just looking at the 2018 midterm results, we can see this fact bearing out in full force. Of the six state legislative chambers that flipped to the Democrats, all were in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Furthermore, all of the seven chambers where Democrats established new supermajorities are in Clinton states.⁵

To explore this phenomenon of nationalized voting behavior, I acquired a dataset of state legislative elections, and the results of the Presidential race in their districts in 2017 / 2018. The specifics of the construction of this data can be found in the **Methodology** tab.

To that end, in 2017 and 2018, 61% of state legislative candidates ran between 5% behind and 5% ahead of the margin of their Presidential counterparts, and a full 87% ran between 10% behind and 10% ahead. That is, for 87% of state legislative elections in the country, no more than 10% of voters voted for differing parties up and down the ballot. This marked a high-water mark for this type of polarization, as the work of Zingher and Richman show.⁴ 

But lurking within that 87% number is an implicit 13% – what happened with these other candidates? How did they manage to do so well or so poorly in comparison to their Presidential standard bearers? Is it the work of individual popularity or scandal? Delays in geographic or partisan realignments? Indeed, they are the **Exceptions** to the rule.
