## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my final project for PSCI 413 in Fall 2020 semester. 

On this website, you'll find the constituent parts of my project. Together, they tell a story about nationalization and polarization at the state legislative level. 

Together, six pages tell the story:

1. The **Introduction** describes how we got here, with some history as well as contemporary observations.
2. Then, I'll explain some **Exceptions** to the rule, using statistics derived from a dataset I constructed.
3. In **Case Study One**, we'll take a look at one Democrat of West Virginia who managed to perform exceptionally well in a time of rampant polarization.
4. In **Case Study Two**, we'll observe a prominent Republican in Connecticut who was able to cut through national politics with a strong family history and a captivating personal story.
5. We'll discuss some **Consequences** of this phenomenon, and how it can alter established electoral atmospheres.
6. And the **Conclusion** wraps it up, with thoughts on the future developments in the area.

Lastly, the expanded **Methodology** explains how the dataset was constructed.

Enjoy!

Solly
