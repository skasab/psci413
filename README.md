## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my final project for PSCI 413 in  Fall 2020 semester. 

On this website, you'll find the constituent parts of my project. Together, they tell a story about nationalization and polarization at the state legislative level. 

Together, six pages tell the story:

1. The **Introduction** describes how we got here.
2. Then, I'll explain some **Exceptions** to the rule.
3. In **Case Study One**, we'll take a look at one Democrat of West Virginia.
4. In **Case Study Two**, we'll observe a prominent Republican in Connecticut.
5. We'll discuss some **Consequences** of this phenomenon.
6. And the **Conclusion** wraps it up. 

Enjoy!

Solly
